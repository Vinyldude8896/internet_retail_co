# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

### User story
As a user who owns a company, I need a secure back end with routes and the ability to create, read, update and delete data from the database. I need to have routes and models created that will allow me to tie this to my front end web app. This app needs to be verified using insomnia, so that I can see that all data is being created, read, updated and deleted properly.
### Features

This app provides a back end server.

This app will also have all CRUD operations to Create, Read, Update and Delete data from the database.
This app will also have an accompaning video walkthrough to show that all CRUD operations are working.
